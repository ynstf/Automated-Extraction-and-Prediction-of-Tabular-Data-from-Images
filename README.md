# Automated Tabular Data Extraction and Prediction

This Python project utilizes image processing and machine learning techniques to automate the extraction and prediction of tabular data from images. The implementation achieves over 80% accuracy and is designed to be versatile for integration into various projects.

## Overview

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository demonstrates the step-by-step process of image preprocessing, contour extraction, digit recognition, and prediction. It involves techniques such as Gaussian blur, adaptive thresholding, contour detection, and Tesseract OCR for recognizing Arabic digits. The project also incorporates a machine learning model to predict the values of the extracted digits.
